# dontforgettohavefun

*debug* - want to make the animation shuffle through the different variants of the phrase "dont forget to have fun"

next steps-

stop and reveal the 'correct' message on hover - 
make it a hyperlink and have a gif open in another window upon click -
control the window size through javascript to fit just the gif on a new window
